RTC-Link II Plus by Steve J. Gray
================

The RTC-Link II was an IEEE Cartridge for the Commodore C64. It enhanced
C64 BASIC by adding the extra disk commands of BASIC V4, plus a full
machine-language monitor. It also adds a "Link" port which enables
multiple computers to access IEEE devices on a sort-of "network".

The original cartridge is a small and simple IEEE interface using a
single PIA chip. To keep the device small it has components on both
sides of the PCB and is able to be mounted inside an AMP connector shell.

This "plus" version is a re-design that retains the same PCB size but with
all components on one side for an easier build. It retains its small size
by using a PLCC EPROM and resistor pack to reduce the component footprints.
Instead of using an edge connector for the "Link" port this version uses
a normal header. There is an option to have two different firmware
revisions, selectable with a jumper.
